DOMAIN:  IMAGE PROCESSING

Image processing is a method to perform some operations on an image, in order to get an enhanced image or to extract some useful information from it. It is a type of signal processing in which input is an image and output may be an image or characteristics or features associated with that image.

Implementation of image processing in rover:

Detection of  Checkpoint

Rover has to detect the checkpoint provided and move towards it and stop at distance specified from the checkpoint.

What is Checkpoint?

Checkpoint is basically an indicator which will be the destination of rover to do some specific task like soil sample collection.

How the checkpoint is detected?

Checkpoint is detected using image processing. Camera analyses each frame and determines the checkpoint and marks it as a target which will be required for further processing.

Role of image processing : 
Detection of target and the distance between target and the rover.
